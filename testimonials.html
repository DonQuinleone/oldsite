                project, look no further than Josh Quinlan! Josh has already amassed a wealth of experience as a music

                "Josh's highly organised production skills, clear communication, and positive and engaging approach to
                working relationships have been a huge asset to the multiple projects I have worked on with him, both in
                his capacity as a producer and engraver. He is quick to respond and I felt confident that I was in safe
                hands!."

                "I mainly know Josh Quinlan‘s work from his singing, and engraving. Both are first class: the singing
                accurate, well blended and expressive, and the engraving superb."

            <i class="testimonial">
                "I consider we were extremely fortunate to have secured Josh for the role - how could we have known that
                so late on we’d get someone so lovely to work with and so committed. In such a short time it was really
                clear that he had prepared the piece and put his heart into it. It was delightful to have Josh and [the
                other soloist] working so well together and it would be our good fortune to work with him again."
