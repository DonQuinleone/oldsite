        <h3>Editing</h3>
        <p>
            As a performer himself, Josh understands the difference that a well-edited score can make to a performance
            or recording, allowing the musician to make music without having to interpret what's on the page in front of
            them.<br /><br />

            <img class="full-width" src="img/swingles-uig.png" alt="" style="object-position: 25% 53.5% !important">
            <br /><br />

            With over a decade of experience in using notation software like Dorico and Sibelius, and an in-depth
            knowledge of standard editorial practice, Josh is able to produce beautiful scores up to publication
            standard. Seeing the engraving process as an art in itself, he will not only ensure that music is presented
            both comprehensibly and elegantly, but also take into consideration your (or your publisher's) house style.
            All he needs is a copy of the score in its current form, whether that be hand-written or notated
            digitally.<br /><br />

            Whatever the demands of the score, Josh is able to find a solution. If you have something very specific in
            mind but there isn't a standard way of notating it, he can create custom graphics that can precisely
            articulate your intentions. You can be confident that all scores and parts produced will be well-spaced,
            have sensible page turns and ultimately reflect your music in the best possible light.<br /><br />

            Josh is able to offer the following services as standard, but is happy to consult with you on a more complex
            project:

            <li>Part extraction from a master score</li>
